## Considerations
This project has been developed as a console application with the primary intention of focusing on the core functionalities and demonstrating proficiency in foundational concepts such as  C# syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP) and basic design patterns.

## Extensibility
In the near future, this project will be extended into a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core, following the Web API and MVC pattern. This will enable greater scalability and integration with front-end applications or other services.

## Features
1. Interactive menu with `menu selector` options
2. Add unique books (physical and e-book) and members (teacher and student) to the system
3. Add, borrow and return book to the library management system
4. Check total books, physical books, e-books, members, teacher members, student members count
